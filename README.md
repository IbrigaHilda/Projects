# Projects  
This repository contains descriptions, implementation codes and slide shows of projects I have worked on over the years. Projects cover the following fields

- Reinforcement Learning  
- Machine Learning 
- Statistics

This repository is a work in progress. My goal is to migrate all my projects into here by the end of 2021 in order to provide a one stop access to them all. Bullet point summary of the projects can be found on my personal webpage at hilda-ibriga.me.

Feel free to go through the projects and do not hesistate to contact me if you have questions.

Best,

Hilda
