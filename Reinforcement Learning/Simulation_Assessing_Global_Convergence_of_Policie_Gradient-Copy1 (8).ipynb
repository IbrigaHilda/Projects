    "## II. BACKGROUND\n",
    " \n",
    " Reinforcement learning is an important type of Machine Learning where an agent learn how to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results. Any reinforcement learning problem can be mathematically formulated using the *state-agent-action-cost*/*state-agent-action-reward* framework. This framework works as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Step 1: The Environment reveals state $x_0$ to the agent.\n",
    " - Step 2: Based on the revealed state $x_0$, the agent takes an action $u_0$.\n",
    " - Step 3: the Environment transitions to a new state $x_1$ and gives some reward $r_1$ or reveals the cost $c_1$ of the action taken by the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of state-action-reward is repeated until the end of the interaction between agent and environment or is repeated indefinitely in the case of an infinite horizon process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the agent in a RL problem is then to learn the sequence of actions $ u_0,...,u_t$ which will lead to the greatest cumulative reward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarities and Differences between RL and Optimal Control Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the above framework was introduced as belonging to Reinforcement Learning, it could also be labelled as an Optimal Control theory framework.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal Control theory and Reinforcement Learning are very similar in that they both seeks to find the sequence of actions which leads to the most reward when an agent interact with an environment. The main difference between the two areas is in the representation of the environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Control theory was originally  born from the engineering fields where the environment behavior is often regulated by well known physics laws. Therefore in optimal control theory the environment state transition function is known or can be mathematically modelled. The goal is then to find the sequence of actions given the known state transition which yields the best reward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand in RL the state transition of the environment (environment behavior) is usually not known. The agent therefore collects data by interacting with the environment not only to learn the best actions but also to learn about the state transition of the environment. <br/ >  \n",

    "### The Linear Quadratic Regulator problem (LQR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper provides convergence guarantees for model free RL methods solving a very specific problem known as the Linear Quadratic Regulator problem. In the LQR problem the state transition is parametrized to be a linear function of the state and action and the reward/cost function is parametrized to be a quadratic function of the state and action. That is:\n",

    "If the parameters $A$, $R$, $Q$, and $B$ were known then the LQR problem becomes a classical optimal control theory problem which has been well studied in the optimal control theory field and performance results are known. In control theory it is known that the optimal action sequence for this problem can be written as a linear combination of the state. That is the\n",

The idea in this paper is to use a method of estimating the optimal policy using a sample based stochastic method approach and once that is done,  borrow tools from optimal control theory to provide convergence guarantees for a family of RL algorithm for the LQR problem.\n",

The work in the paper focuses on a type of model-free method known as the **sample based policy gradient methods**. I provide some intuition as to how  this type of method works in the next few paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is known from optimal control theory that the optimal policy can be written as a linear combination of the state \n",
    "$ u_t=-K^{*}x_t$ then the cost of the policy $K$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "           C(K):= \\mathbb{E}_{x_0 \\sim D}\\left[\\sum^{t=0}_{\\infty}(x^{T}_{t}Qx_{t}+u^{T}_{t}Ru_{t})\\right]\n",

    "### Proof Sketch\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide some intuition to the proof of the main theorem, I break of the sketch of the proof into three parts. These three parts represent the three area of difficulties for completing the proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Section 3.2.1: Characterizing the non-convexity of the problem\n",
    "- Section 3.2.2: Gradient Dominant ion and Almost Continuity of the objective function $ C(K)$\n",
    "- Section 3.2.3: Applying the Zeroth Order optimization method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characterizing the non-convexity of the problem\n",
    "The optimization problem in equation of $C(K)$ is non-convex which means that even if the sample based policy method converges it is not guaranteed to converge to a global optima and can get stuck at a local optima. Hence the first step in the proof of the theorem is to reveal the characteristics of the non-convexity of the problem. This is done through Lemma 2 and Corollary 3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors start by looking at the case in which the gradient $ \\nabla C(k)$ and fisher information matrix $\\Sigma_k$ are known. Remember that this is not the case for the sample based gradient descent and natural policy gradient methods but it is a starting point for the proof. The idea is that once the problem is solved for the exact gradient and fisher information case the zeroth order optimization strategy introduced algorithm 1 will lead to showing the result for the sample based case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemma 2 shows that for state dimension $d\\geq3$ there exists a LQR problem which objective function is not convex, not quasi convex or star convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the problem is non-convex the authors then go to show that in the case of the LQR problem gradient descent and the natural policy gradient descent might still converge to a global optima. This demonstrated using Corollary 3, where it is shown that when $\\nabla C(K)$ then there are two possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. K is an optimal policy or\n",
    "2. $ \\Sigma_K$ is rank deficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this characterization of the non-convexity of the problem. It becomes clear how we can guarantee that the gradient descent will converge to the global optima. That is as long as we ensure that the fisher information matrix of the state space $\\Sigma_K$ is not rank deficient then exact gradient descent or the exact natural policy gradient descent will converge to the optimal policy $K^{*}$ when $\\nabla C(K)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is met by using a distribution over the starting state $x_0$ instead of having a deterministic starting point. This would guarantee that the fisher information matrix $\\Sigma_k$ is full rank. Notice that condition was including in the optimization problem in equation  $\\eqref{eq:cmax}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also provide a small section title mathematical background which contains a list of mathematical results from linear algebra, st theory and real analysis and control theory necessary to understand the detail of the proof. In my final report I plan on pointing exactly where this method are used in the reader can feel in the gap using these background results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Domination and Almost Smoothness of the objective function $ C(K)$\n",
    "Now that we understand that the optimization problem has only one optima as long as the fisher information matrix is full rank, It remains to show that iteration of the gradient descent and natural policy gradient descent moves towards the global optima. That is which wish to prove that there is a contract at every step of the gradient descent or natural policy gradient descent. In order to obtain this contraction result, the authors show that the objective function $C(K)$ is **gradient dominated** in Lemma 8. That is there is a constant $ \\lambda$ such that for all policy $K$ we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " C(K)-C(K^{*})\\leq \\lambda \\| \\nabla C(K)\\| \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient dominance implies that if the magnitude of the gradient is small at some $K$, then $C(K)$ is close to the optimal cost $C(K^{*})$.\\\\\n",
    "Knowing that the objective function is gradient dominated is not enough to show that the gradient descent converges quickly to the global optimal. This would be the case if the objective function is a smooth function (convergence at a linear rate). However if the objective function is not smooth the gradient descent algorithm might take forever to find the global optima.\n",
    "The next step then from the authors was to characterized the smoothness of the objective function. $C(K)$ is shown to be almost smooth in Lemma 9. That is for any policy $K$ and $K^{'}$, $ C(K)$ satisfies: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "|C(K')-C(K)-Tr((K'-K)^T \\nabla C(k))|\\leq \\beta\\|K-K'\\|+ \\mathcal{O}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the lemmas in the paper are helper lemmas for establishing Lemma 9.\n",
    "Once it is proven that the objective function is almost smooth and gradient dominated it is straight forward show that there is a contraction every step of the gradient descent or natural gradient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying the Zeroth Order optimization method\n",
    "The last step in the proof is to reconcile the fact that the exact gradient were not used in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 is known as a *zero order algorithm*. In optimization, Zero-order (or derivative-free) algorithms use only the function value at some point in order to estimate the gradient of the function. It does not require a close form of the objective function only simulation point. It is called Zeroth order because no derivative is used. \n",
    "We notice that Algorithm 1 estimated the gradient $\\nabla C(K)$ only using values of $ C(K)$ In the algorithm a Markov simulation is generated by perturbing the input policy $K$ in the following way\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "K_{perturbed}=K+U\n",

    "$K_{perturbed}$ is used to generate the sequence of state and action ${x_t,u_t}$ for $t = 1 to t=T$. The estimate $\\widehat{C(K)}$ and $ \\Sigma_K$ are then obtained as the finite sum of the cost and covariance matrix at each time $t$ . \n",
    "Other perturbation are created and the estimate of the gradient is given as the empiral mean of all perturbed  $\\widehat{C(K)}$.\n",
    "In order to complete the proof of the theorem the author proved the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The finite horizon approximation $\\widehat{C(K)}$ and $\\widehat{\\Sigma_K}$ in Algorithm 1 can be made as close as desired to $C(K)$ and $\\Sigma_k$ \n",
    "- If $K'$ is a perturbation of $K$ then $C(K')$ is close to $C(K)$ and $\\nabla C(K')$ is close to $\\nabla C(K)$. \n",

    "### Describing the Cart-pole Problem\n",
    "A cart moves along the horizontal axis and a pole is attached to the cart. At every time step $t$, we can observe the state of the environment which consists of the {position, velocity} of the cart and the {angle and rotation rate} of the pole .\n",
    "\n",
    "The state  of the environment at any time $x_t$ is therefore a four dimensional vector. At any given state, the cart has only two possible actions: move to the left or the right of the horizontal axis. The action set can therefore be coded as {1,0} for moving left or right respectively.\n",
    "We get a reward as long as the pole is still attached to the cart at a certain angle at each time step. If the pole falls beyond a certain angle, then the episode is over. The problem is considered solved when the agent accumulates a given amount of rewards.\n",

    "I used a one layer neural network with $32$ nodes and the ReLu activating function to represent the policy gradient model. The gradient descent learning rate was set to $0.001$ with a decay parameter of $0.999$, hence making the learning rate adaptive (this means that large steps are taken in the gradient descent at the beginning then smaller steps are taken has time progresses) this has shown to lead to faster convergence than setting the learning rate to be a constant.  \n",

    "The batch size for updating the weights of the neural network was set to 6 after trying various numbers. This number means that the gradient of the neural network weights are only updated after every sixth time steps.  \n",
    "The neural network input is the four dimensional state values \\{position, velocity, angle and rotation\\}, the output of the neural network is the probability of of moving left or right. The cross entropy loss function of the discounted reward was used as loss function. The cumulative reward discount rate $\\gamma$ was set to $0.99$. This means that future rewards are also highly valued.\n",

    "- **Model-based policy gradient algorithm**: The second algorithm I used for simulation purpose is the model-based policy gradient algorithm.  \n",

    "This algorithm first attempts to learn a model of the environment before it learns the optimal policy.

    "\n",
    "I used a one layer neural network with $250$ nodes in order to learn the model of the environment. The input of the neural network is the \\{position, velocity, angle and rotation rate of the pole\\} and the action taken at time $t$ obtained from the environment. The output of the neural network is the predicted  state ( position, velocity, angle and rotation rate of the pole) at time time $t+1$, the predicted reward at time $t+1$ and the whether the pole falls or not at time $t+1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the state of the cart and the reward obtained at time $t+1$, I used the square error loss function to compute the gradient and update the weights of the position and reward weights.  \n",

    "In the model-based algorithm, I used the first 200 episodes of the simulation to get a good initial estimate of the environment model then I began to alternate between estimating the model of the environment and estimating the optimal policy. The optimal policy in this case was obtained using a similar algorithm as that of the model-free presented above the only difference being that the observations used were not from the environment but were obtained from prediction from the learned environment model.\n",

    "For both model-based and model-free methods, I run the simulation for $1200$ episodes. In order to present the performance of the two algorithms, I computed a running average of the reward obtained per episode.  I used a window size of $10$ to  compute the running average reward. The results of the simulation for the model-free policy gradient method is provided in the form of a graph in figure $3$ and the results for the model-based method is presented in figure $4$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We notice from these two figures that the model-free algorithm yields larger reward. Within only $600$ episodes the model had hit a mean reward of $200$ while the model-based method was still at a mean reward of $60$. \n",
    "In the end after $1200$ episodes the model-free algorithm had a cumulative reward of $200$ and the model-based algorithm had a reward of $156$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these results, it is quite tempting to think that the model-free algorithm is outperforming the model-based algorithm which is true if we only focus on the cumulative reward. However if we look at figures $3$ and $4$ closely, we notice that the model-based algorithm reward function is less noisy compared to the model-free model which experiences very sharp deeps in it reward from time to time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence even though the model-based algorithm takes longer to learn the optimal policy, it does so with less trial and error moves. This can be explained by the fact that once a good model of the environment is learned, the predicted observations obtained from the environment model are less noisy than the observations obtained directly from the environment itself. Hence the model based approach in the long run uses better quality input than the model free algorithm in order to learn the optimal policy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure $5$ shows the results of the model of the environment learned using the model-based algorithm. The orange line represents the observed values from the environment and the blue line represents the predicted values obtained from the neural network model of the environment. The plots represents the results of the last $200$ episodes of running the simulation. We notice that the neural network did a good job at predicting, the state of the environment and the reward received by the agent.\n",

    "### Technical Details\n",
    "I used the cart-pole environment infrastructure provided on Open AI gym in order to simulate the Markov decision process of the cart and the pole. The algorithm were implemented in Python version $3.7.1$. I then used tensorflow version ($1.12$) within python in order to speed-up computing the gradient approximation for the neural networks at each time step.\n",
    "I also created a virtual animation of the cart-pole to show the learning process of the two algorithms live.\n",
